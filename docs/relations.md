## Working With Relations

Relations can be used for joins in EntityFetcher and of course to fetch related objects from Entity. In this doc we
want to describe how and what else you can do with these relations. How to add relations and how to remove relations.

All examples refer to this definitions:

```php
<?php

class Article extends ORM\Entity {
    protected static $relations = [
        'additionalData' => ['one', ArticleAdditionalData::class, 'article'],
        'comments' => [ArticleComments::class, 'article'],
        'categories' => [Category::class, ['id' => 'articleId'], 'articles', 'article_category'],
        'writer' => [User::class, ['userId' => 'id']]
    ];
}

class ArticleAdditionalData extends ORM\Entity {
    protected static $relations = [
        'article' => [Article::class, ['articleId' => 'id']]
    ];
}

class ArticleComments extends ORM\Entity {
    protected static $relations = [
        'article' => [Article::class, ['articleId' => 'id']]
    ];
}

class Category extends ORM\Entity {
    protected static $relations = [
        'articles' => [Article::class, ['id' => 'categoryId'], 'categories', 'article_category']
    ];
}

class User extends ORM\Entity {}

$em = new \ORM\EntityManager();
```

### Fetch relations

You can fetch relations with `fetch($relation)` and with `getRelated($relation)` (or the magic getter). For a relation
with cardinality *one* you will always receive the Entity (or null). But for relations with cardinality *many* you will
receive an array from getter and an `EntityFetcher` from fetch.

The getter will only execute a query when it is not fetched previously. Fetch will always call `fetch($class)` on the
`EntityManager`. For an owner it can use the primary key and therefore it can use the mapping without executing a 
query.

For *many-to-many* relations the getter will first fetch all primary ids from relation table and then use
`fetch($class, $primaryKey)` from `EntityManager`.  Under some circumstances this can be faster.

The method `getRelated($relation)` can be called by magic getter with the name of the relation as property. This might
not work when there is a column with the same name as the relation.

```php
<?php

/** @var Article $article */
$article = $em->fetch(Article::class, 1);

echo get_class($article->getRelated('writer')), "\n"; // User
echo get_class($article->writer), "\n"; // User
echo get_class($article->fetch('writer')), "\n"; // User

echo gettype($article->getRelated('comments')), "\n"; // array
echo get_class($article->getRelated('comments')[0]), "\n"; // ArticleComment
echo get_class($article->fetch('comments')), "\n"; // ORM\EntityFetcher
```

### Update Relations

You can update relations with `setRelated($relation, $entities)`. For the owner in relations this will just call 
`__set($key, $entity->__get($value))` (key and value are from the relation definition). For non owner in *one-to-one*
and *one-to-many* relations it calls `setRelated($opponent, $this)` to each entity.

The methods do not store the data (neither they don't care about whether the related class is persisted or not). To
store the data you have to call save on each entity. The other problem you might encounter is: it does not update non
related entities - you will have to call `$articleComment->setRelated('article', null)` to remove the writer.

**Many-to-many is differnt**: for *many-to-many* relations there is no owner. You can not just set the related entity.
So there are two other methods: `addRelations($relation, $entities)` and `deleteRelations($relation, $entities)`.

```php
<?php

// Example - Create a comment:
/** @var Article $article */
if ($article = $em->fetch(Article::class, 1)) {
    $comment = new ArticleComment();
    $comment->author = 'iras';
    $comment->text = 'Awesome!';
    $comment->setRelated('article', $article);
    $comment->save($em);
}

// Example - create an article
/** @var User $user */
if ($user = @$_SESSION['user']) {
    $em->getConnection()->beginTransaction();
    
    $article = new Article();
    $article->title = 'An amazing title that points out nothing';
    $article->setRelated('writer', $user);
    $article->addRelations('categories', [$em->fetch(Category::class)->where('key', 'php')]);
    $article->save();
    
    $additional = new ArticleAdditionalData();
    $additional->text = 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...';
    $additional->setRelated('article', $article);
    $additional->save();
    
    $em->getConnection()->commit();
}

// Example - update categories
/** @var Article $article */
if ($article = $em->fetch(Article::class, 1)) {
    $currentCategories = $article->getRelated('categories')->all();
    $categoryKeys = $_POST['categories'];
    $newCategories = $em->fetch(Category::class)->where('key', $categoryKeys)->all();
    
    $em->getConnection()->beginTransaction();
    $article->deleteRelations(array_diff($currentCategories, $newCategories));
    $article->addRelations(array_diff($newCategories, $currentCategories));
    $em->getConnection()->commit();
}
```
